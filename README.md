Project Motivation
This project is my first data mining project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. For all prospective Airbnb hosts in Seattle, I was interested in the following questions:

When are typically listings available?
What is the distribution of the listing price?
Can we predict the price of a new listing based on some of its attributes?
What factors make the most difference in terms of pricing?
What’s the review score for each listing?
File Descriptions
There are three files in the dataset, which were downloaded from Kaggle.
listings.csv - includes full descriptions and average review score
calendar.csv - includes listing id and the price and availability for that day
reviews.csv - includes unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments

We'll be using all three files individually for analysis, the main analysis and data exploration can be found here.

Results
The whole article can be found through a Medium post publicly available through here.
